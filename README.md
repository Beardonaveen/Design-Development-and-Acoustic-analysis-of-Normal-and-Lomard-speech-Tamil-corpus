# Design-Development-and-Acoustic-analysis-of-Normal-and-Lomard-speech-Tamil-corpus
The project involves creating a Tamil speech corpus for both normal and Lombard speech, where the Lombard effect refers to speech changes in noisy conditions. It includes designing the corpus, collecting and annotating data, and analyzing acoustic features to improve speech recognition and synthesis systems in noisy environments.

# Tamil Speech Corpus for Normal and Lombard Speech

## Overview

This project involves the design, development, and acoustic analysis of a Tamil speech corpus comprising both normal and Lombard speech. The Lombard effect describes speech modifications in response to ambient noise, which affects vocal effort and speech characteristics. This corpus aims to enhance speech recognition and synthesis systems by capturing these variations.

## Project Structure

- **Data Collection:** Speech samples recorded in normal and noisy conditions.
- **Annotation:** Detailed labeling of data with metadata including speaker information and recording conditions.
- **Acoustic Analysis:** Examination of speech features like pitch, intensity, and formant frequencies.
- **Machine Learning Model:** A simple model to classify normal vs. Lombard speech.

## Installation

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tamil-speech-corpus.git
   cd tamil-speech-corpus
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Make sure you have Python 3.7 or later installed. Then, install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Data:**

   Ensure the speech corpus is placed in the `data/` directory.

## Data

The dataset includes:
- **Normal Speech:** Speech samples recorded in quiet environments.
- **Lombard Speech:** Speech samples recorded in noisy conditions.

Files are organized by speaker and condition for ease of use.

## Acoustic Analysis

Scripts for analyzing acoustic features are provided in the `acoustic_analysis/` directory. Use these scripts to extract features such as pitch, intensity, and formant frequencies from the speech samples.

## Machine Learning Model

A simple ML model is included to classify speech samples as normal or Lombard. 

### Model Training

1. **Prepare Data:**
   Ensure your data is preprocessed and features are extracted. Place the data in `features/`.

2. **Train Model:**
   Run the training script:

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

   This script will train a simple classification model using features extracted from the speech samples.

### Model Inference

To classify new speech samples:

1. **Extract Features:**
   Run the feature extraction script:

   ```bash
   python extract_features.py --input path_to_audio_file --output path_to_features
   ```

2. **Classify:**
   Run the inference script:

   ```bash
   python classify_speech.py --input path_to_features
   ```

## Usage

Refer to the `examples/` directory for sample scripts on how to use the corpus and ML model for your research or application needs.
